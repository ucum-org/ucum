# UCUM

The Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) is a code system intended to include all units of measures being contemporarily used in international science, engineering, and business. The purpose is to facilitate unambiguous electronic communication of quantities together with their units. The focus is on electronic communication, as opposed to communication between humans. A typical application of The Unified Code for Units of Measure are electronic data interchange (EDI) protocols, but there is nothing that prevents it from being used in other types of machine communication.

In September 2022, UCUM fully migrated its platform from a self-hosted Subversion repository and Trac ticketing system to GitHub. Please pardon our dust as we continue to evolve. We ask that you submit errors or questions using GitHub's [Issues](https://github.com/ucum-org/ucum/issues) feature.

The UCUM website is available at [https://ucum.org](https://ucum.org). All previous links should redirect to their new locations.
