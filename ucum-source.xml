    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p>
&TUCUM; is a code system intended to include <emph>all</emph> units of
measures being contemporarily used in international science,
engineering, and business. The purpose is to facilitate unambiguous
electronic communication of quantities together with their units. The
focus is on electronic communication, as opposed to communication
between humans. A typical application of &TUCUM; are electronic data
interchange (EDI) protocols, but there is nothing that prevents it
from being used in other types of machine communication.
    </p>
    <p>
&TUCUM; is inspired by and heavily based on ISO&nbsp;2955-1983, ANSI
X3.50-1986, and HL7's extensions called &ldquo;ISO+&rdquo;. The
respective ISO and ANSI standards are both entitled
&ldquo;Representation of [...]  units in systems with limited
character sets&rdquo; where ISO&nbsp;2955 refers to SI and other units
provided by ISO&nbsp;1000-1981, while ANSI X3.50 extends ISO&nbsp;2955 to
include U.S. customary units. Because these standards carry the
restriction of &ldquo;limited character sets&rdquo; in their names
they seem to be of less value today, when graphical user interfaces and
laser printers are in wide-spread use. For this reason, the European
standard ENV&nbsp;12435 in its clause 7.3 declares ISO&nbsp;2955 obsolete.
    </p>
    <p>
ENV&nbsp;12435 is dedicated exclusively to the communication of
measurements between humans in display and print, and does not provide
codes that can be used in communication between systems. It does not
even provide a specification that would allow communication of units
from one system to the screen or printer of another system. The issue
about displaying units in the common style defined by the 9th
<emph>Conf&eacute;rence G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Poids et Mesures</emph>
(CGPM) in 1947 is not just the character set. Although the
<emph>Unicode</emph> standard and its predecessor ISO/IEC&nbsp;10646 is
the richest character set ever, it is still not enough to specify the
presentation of units, because there are important typographical
details such as superscripts, subscripts, roman and
italics.<footnote>
         <p>
Interestingly the authors of ENV&nbsp;12435 forgot to include
superscripts in the minimum requirements as given by subclause 7.1.4
for which they do not specify an alternative.
         </p>
       </footnote>
    </p>
    <p>
The real value of the restriction on the character set and
typographical details, however, is not to cope with legacy systems and
less powerful technology, but to facilitate unambiguous communication
and interpretation of the meaning of units from one computer system to
another. In this respect, ISO&nbsp;2955 and ANSI X3.50 are not
obsolete because there is no other standard that would fill in for
inter-systems communication of units. However, ISO&nbsp;2599 and ANSI
X3.50 currently have severe defects:
    </p>
    <list role="ordered">
      <item>
        <p>
ISO&nbsp;2955 and ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 contain numerous name conflicts,
both direct conflicts (e.g., &ldquo;<code>a</code>&rdquo; being used
for both &ldquo;year&rdquo; and &ldquo;are&rdquo;) and conflicts
that are generated through combination of unit symbols with prefixes
(e.g., &ldquo;<code>cd</code>&rdquo; means candela and centi-day and
&ldquo;<code>PEV</code>&rdquo; means peta-volt and pico-electronvolt.)
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
Neither ISO&nbsp;2955 nor ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 cover all units that are
currently used in practice. There are many more units in use than what
is allowed by the <emph>Syst&egrave;me International
d'Unit&eacute;s</emph> (SI) and accompanying standards. For example,
the older CGM-units dyne and erg are still used in the science of
physiology. Although ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 extends ISO&nbsp;2955 with some
U.S. customary units, it is still not complete in this respect. For
example it does not define the degree Fahrenheit.
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 is semantically ambiguous with respect to customary
units, even if we do not consider the history and international
aspects of customary units. Three systems of mass units are used in
the U.S., avoirdupois used generally, apothecaries' used by
pharmacists, and troy used in trade with Gold and other precious
metals. ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 has no way to select any one of those
specifically, which is bad in medicine, where both apothecaries' and
avoirdupois weights are being used frequently.
        </p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>
ISO&nbsp;2955 and all standards that do only look for the resolutions
and recommendations of the CGPM and the <emph>Comit&eacute;
International des Poids et Mesures</emph> (CIPM) as published by the
<emph>Bureau International des Poids et Mesures</emph> (BIPM) and various
ISO standards (ISO&nbsp;1000 and ISO&nbsp;31) fail to recognize that
the needs in practice are often different from the ideal propositions
of the CGPM. Although not allowed by the CGPM and related ISO
standards, many other units are used in international sciences,
healthcare, engineering, and business, both meaningfully and some
units of questionable meaning. A coding system that is to be useful in
practice must cover the requirements and habits of the
practice&mdash;even some of the bad habits.
    </p>
    <p>
None of the current standards attempt to specify a semantics of units
that can be deployed in information systems with moderate
requirements. Metrological standards such as those published by the
BIPM are dedicated to maximal scientific correctness of reproducible
definitions of units. These definitions make sense only to human
specialists and can hardly be deployed to their full extent by any
information system that is not dedicated to metrology. On the other
hand, ISO&nbsp;2955 and ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 provide no semantics at all for the
codes they define.
    </p>
    <p>
&TUCUM; provides a single coding system for units that is complete,
free of all ambiguities, and that assigns to each defined unit a
concise semantics. In communication it is not only important that all
communicating parties have the same repertoire of symbols, but also that
all attach the same meaning to the symbols they exchange. The common
meaning must be computationally verifiable. &TUCUM; assumes a
semantics for units based on dimensional analysis.<footnote>
        <p>
A more extensive introduction into this semantics of units can be
found in: Schadow G, McDonald CJ et al: Units of Measure in Clinical
Information Systems; <it>JAMIA</it> 6(2); Mar/Apr 1999;
p.&nbsp;151&ndash;162.
        </p>
      </footnote>
    </p>
    <p>
<!-- FIXME this paragraph is a lump: we need Roadmap, scope, etc. -->
In short, each unit is defined relative to a system of base units by a
numeric factor and a vector of exponents by which the base units
contribute to the unit to be defined. Although we can reflect all the
meaning of units covered by dimensional analysis with this vector
notation, the following tables do not show these vectors. One reason
is that the vectors depend on the base system chosen and even on the
ordering of the base units. The other reason is that these vectors are
hard to understand to human readers while they can be easily derived
computationally. Therefore we define new unit symbols using algebraic
terms of other units. Those algebraic terms are also valid codes of
&TUCUM;.
    </p>
  </div1>

  <div1>
    <head>Grammar of Units and Unit Terms</head>
    <p name="preliminaries">
<verse>
&TUCUM; consists of a basic set of terminal symbols for units, called
<emph>atomic unit symbols</emph> or <emph>unit atoms</emph>, and multiplier
prefixes. It also consists of an expression syntax by which these
symbols can be combined to yield valid units.
</verse>

<verse>
The tables of terminal symbols are fixed as of every revision of
&TUCUM;, additions, deletions or changes are <emph>not</emph> allowed.
</verse>

<verse>
All expression that can be derived from these terminal symbols and the
expression syntax are valid codes. Any expression of &TUCUM; has a
precisely defined semantics.
</verse>
    </p>
    <comment>
      <p>
The expression syntax of &TUCUM; generates an infinite number of codes
with the consequence that it is impossible to compile a table of all
valid units.
       </p>
       <p>
That the tables of terminal symbols may not be extended does not mean
that missing symbols will never be available in &TUCUM;. Suggestions
for additions of new symbols are welcome and revisions of
&TUCUM; will be released as soon as a change request has been approved.
       </p>
     </comment>
     <p name="full and limited conformance">
<verse> 
The semantics of &TUCUM; implies equivalence classes such that
different expressions may have the same meaning.
</verse>

<verse> 
Programs that declare <emph>full conformance</emph> with &TUCUM; must
compare unit expressions by their semantics, i.e. they must detect
equivalence for different expressions with the same meaning.
</verse>

<verse>
Programs with <emph>limited conformance</emph> may compare unit expressions
literally and thus may not detect equivalence of unit expressions.
</verse>
    </p>

    <comment>
      <p>
The option for &ldquo;limited conformance&rdquo; allows &TUCUM; to be adopted
even by less powerful systems that can not or do not want to deal with
the full semantics of units. Those systems typically have a table of
fixed unit expression literals that may be related to other literals
with fixed conversion factors. Although these systems will have
difficulties to receive unit expressions from various sources, they
will at least send out valid expressions of &TUCUM;, which is an
important step towards a commonly used coding scheme for units.
      </p>

  <div2>
    <head>Character Set and Lexical Rules</head>
    <p name="character set">
<verse> All expressions of &TUCUM; shall be built from characters of
the 7-bit US-ASCII character set exclusively.
</verse>

<verse> Terminal unit symbols can consist of all ASCII characters in
the range of 33&ndash;126 (0x21&ndash;0x7E) excluding

double quotes (&lquo;<code>"</code>&rquo;),
parentheses (&lquo;<code>(</code>&rquo; and &lquo;<code>)</code>&rquo;),
plus sign (&lquo;<code>+</code>&rquo;'),
minus sign (&lquo;<code>-</code>&rquo;'),
period (&lquo;<code>.</code>&rquo;'),
solidus (&lquo;<code>/</code>&rquo;'),
equal sign (&lquo;<code>=</code>&rquo;'),
square brackets (&lquo;<code>[</code>&rquo; 
    and &lquo;<code>]</code>&rquo;), and
curly braces (&lquo;<code>{</code>&rquo; and &lquo;<code>}</code>&rquo;),

which have special meaning. 
</verse>

<verse> A terminal unit symbol can not consist of only digits
(&lquo;<code>0</code>&rquo;&ndash;&lquo;<code>9</code>&rquo;) because
those digit strings are interpreted as positive integer
numbers. However, a symbol &ldquo;<code>10*</code>&rdquo; is allowed
because it ends with a non-digit allowed to be part of a symbol.
</verse>

<verse> For every terminal symbol there is a case insensitive variant
defined, to be used when there is a risk of upper and lower case to be
confused. Although upper and lower case can be mixed in case
insensitive symbols there is no meaning to the case. Case insensitive
symbols are incompatible to the case sensitive symbols.
</verse>
    </p>

    <comment>
      <p>
The 7-bit US-ASCII character code is the greatest common denominator
that can be expected to be available in any communication environment.
Only very few units normally require symbols from the Greek alphabet
and thus the cost of requiring Unicode does not outweigh the benefit.
As explained above, the real issue about writing unit terms naturally
is not the character set but the ability to write subscripts and
superscripts and distinguish roman letters from italics.
      </p>
      <p>
Some computer systems or programming languages still have the
requirement of case insensitivity and some humans who are not familiar
with SI units tend to confuse upper and lower case or can not
interpret the difference in upper and lower case correctly. For this
reason the case insensitive symbols are defined. Although &TUCUM;
does not encourage use of case insensitive symbols where not
absolutely necessary, in some circumstances the case insensitive
representation may be the greatest common denominator. Thus some
systems that can handle case sensitivity may end up using case
insensitive symbols in order to communicate with less powerful
systems.
      </p>
      <p>
ISO&nbsp;2955 and ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 call case sensitive symbols &ldquo;mixed
case&rdquo; and case insensitive symbols &ldquo;single case&rdquo; and
list two columns for &ldquo;single case&rdquo; symbols, one for upper
case and one for lower case.  In &TUCUM; all units can be written in
mixed upper and lower case, but in the case insensitive variant the
mixing of case does not matter.
      </p>
			<p>
White space is not recognized in a a unit term and should generally 
not occur. UCUM implementations may flag whitespace as an error 
rather than ignore it. Whitespace is not used as a separator of 
otherwise ambiguous parts of a unit term.

    <p name="prefixes">
<verse>Metric units (cf. <pref ref="para-metric"/>) may be
combinations of a unit symbol with a prefix symbol.
</verse>

<verse>The unit symbol to be combined with the prefix must not itself
contain a prefix. Such a prefix-less unit symbol is called <emph>unit
atom</emph>.
</verse>

<verse>Prefix and atom are connected immediately without any

the lexical level by finding a matching combination of an optional
prefix and a unit atom.
</verse>

<verse> The prefix is the longest leading substring that matches a
valid prefix where the remainder is a valid metric unit atom. If no
such prefix can be matched, the unit atom is without prefix and may be
both metric or non-metric.</verse>

For example
%
&ldquo;<code>[abc+ef]</code>&rdquo;,
&ldquo;<code>ab[c+ef]</code>&rdquo;,
&ldquo;<code>[abc+]ef</code>&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;<code>ab[c+ef]</code>&rdquo;
%
could all be valid symbols if defined in the tables. 
In &ldquo;<code>ab[c+ef]</code>&rdquo; either
&ldquo;<code>a</code>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<code>ab</code>&rdquo; 
could be defined as a prefix, but not &ldquo;<code>ab[c</code>&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
Square brackets take on one task of round parentheses in HL7's
&ldquo;ISO+&rdquo; code, where one use of parentheses is to augment
unit symbols with suffixes, as in &ldquo;<code>mm(Hg)</code>&rdquo;.
Another use is to enclose one full unit symbol into parentheses, as
&ldquo;<code>(ka_u)</code>&rdquo; (for the King-Armstrong unit of
catalytic amount of phosphatase).  Apparently, in a unit symbol such
enclosed one is supposed not to expect a prefix. Thus, even if
&ldquo;<code>a_u</code>&rdquo; would have been defined,
&ldquo;<code>(ka_u)</code>&rdquo; should not be matched against
kilo-<code>a_u</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
Parentheses, however, were also used for the nesting of terms since
HL7 version 2.3. At this point it became ambiguous whether parentheses
are part of the unit symbol or whether they are syntactic tokens. For
instance, &ldquo;<code>(ka_u)</code>&rdquo; could mean a nested
&ldquo;<code>ka_u</code>&rdquo; (where &ldquo;<code>k</code>&rdquo;
could possibly be a prefix), but also the proper symbol
&ldquo;<code>(ka_u)</code>&rdquo; that happens to have parentheses as
part of the symbol. &TUCUM; uses parentheses for the usual meaning of
term nesting and uses square brackets where HL7's &ldquo;ISO+&rdquo;
assumes parentheses to be part of the unit symbol.

    <p name="curly braces">

<verse> The full range of characters 33&ndash;126 can be used within a
pair of curly braces (&lquo;<code>{</code>&rquo; and
&lquo;<code>}</code>&rquo;). The material enclosed in curly braces is
called <emph>annotation</emph>.
</verse>

<verse> 
Annotations do not contribute to the semantics of the unit but are
meaningless by definition. Therefore, any fully conformant parser must
discard all annotations. Parsers of limited conformance <emph>should</emph>
not value annotations in comparison of units.
</verse>

<verse>
Annotations do, however, signify the end of a unit symbol.
</verse>

<verse> An annotation without a leading symbol implies the default
unit <unit>1</unit> (the unity).
</verse>

<verse> 
Curly braces must not be nested.
</verse>
    </p>

    <comment>
      <p>
Curly braces are here because people want annotations and deeply
believe that they need annotations. Especially in chemistry and
biomedical sciences, there are traditional habits to write annotations
at units or instead of units, such as &ldquo;%vol.&rdquo;,
&ldquo;RBC&rdquo;, &ldquo;CFU&rdquo;, &ldquo;kg(wet tis.)&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;mL(total)&rdquo;. These habits are hard to overcome. Any
attempt of a coding scheme to restrict this perceived expressiveness
will ultimately result in the coding scheme not being adopted, or just
&ldquo;half-way&rdquo; adopted (which is as bad as not adopted).
      </p>
      <p>
Two alternative responses to this reality exist: either give in to the
bad habits and blow up of the code with dimension- and meaningless
unit atoms, or canalize this habit so that it does no harm. &TUCUM;
canalizes this habit using curly braces. Nevertheless we do continuing
efforts to upgrade doubtful units to genuine units of &TUCUM; by
defining and linking them to the other units as good as
possible. Thus, &ldquo;<code>g%</code>&rdquo; is a valid metric unit
atom (so that &ldquo;<code>mg%</code>&rdquo; is a valid unit too.)
A <emph>drops</emph>, although quite imprecise, is a valid unit of volume
&ldquo;<code>[drp]</code>&rdquo;. Even HPF and LPF (the so called
&ldquo;high-&rdquo; and &ldquo;low power field&rdquo; in the
microscope) have been defined so that at least they relate to each
other.

division (solidus &lquo;<code>/</code>&rquo;). </verse>

<verse> The multiplication operator is mandatory it must not be
omitted or replaced by a space. The multiplication operator is a
strict binary operator that may occur only <emph>between two</emph> unit

<verse> The division operator can be used as a binary and unary
operator, i.e. a leading solidus will invert the unit that directly

    </p>
    <comment>
      <p>
The use of the period instead of the asterisk
(&lquo;<code>*</code>&rquo;) as a multiplication operator continues a
tradition codified in ISO&nbsp;1000 and maintained in ISO&nbsp;2955. Because
floating point numbers may not occur in unit terms the period is not
ambiguous. A period in a unit term has no other meaning than to be the
multiplication operator.
      </p>
      <p>
Since Resolution 7 of the 9th CGPM in 1948 the myth of ambiguity being
introduced by more than one solidus lives on and is quoted in all
standards concerning the writing of SI units. However, when the strict
left to right rule is followed there is no ambiguity, neither with one
solidus nor with more than one solidus. However, in human practice we
find the tendency to assign a lower precedence to the solidus which
misleads people to write <v>a</v>/<v>b</v>&middot;<v>c</v> when they
really mean <v>a</v>/(<v>b</v>&middot;<v>c</v>). When this is
rewritten as <v>a</v>/<v>b</v>/<v>c</v> there is actually less
ambiguity that in <v>a</v>/<v>b</v>&middot;<v>c</v>. So the real
source of ambiguity is when a multiplication operator follows a
solidus, not when there is more than one solidus in a term. Hence, we
remove the restriction for only one solidus and introduce parentheses
which may be used to remove any perceived ambiguity.

ISO&nbsp;2955 and ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 actually do not allow a plus sign leading a
positive exponent. However, if there can be any perceived ambiguities,
an explicit leading plus sign may be of help sometimes. <emph>The
Unified Code for Units of Measures</emph> therefore allows such plus signs
at exponents. The plus sign on positive exponents can be used to
delimit exponents from integer numbers used as simple units. Thus,
<code>2+10</code> means 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024.

a simple unit, an exponent may follow on a closing parenthesis which
raises the whole term within the parentheses to the power.&rdquo;
However this feature was inconsistent with any BNF or other syntax

If we receive indication that this feature was used by anyone, we

      <head>The Predicate &ldquo;Metric&rdquo;</head>
      <p id="para-metric" name="metric and non-metric unit atoms">

<verse> Only metric unit atoms may be combined with a prefix.
</verse>

<verse> To be metric or not to be metric is a predicate assigned to
each unit atom where that unit atom is defined.
</verse>

<verse> All base units are metric. No non-metric unit can be part of
the basis.
</verse>

<verse> A unit must be a quantity on a ratio scale in order to be
metric.
</verse>
   </p>
   <comment>
     <p>
The metric predicate accounts for the fact that there are units that
are prefixed and others that are not. This helps to disambiguate the
parsing of simple units into prefix and atom.
     </p>
     <p>
To determine whether a given unit atom is metric or not is not
trivial. It is a cultural phenomenon, subject to change, just like
language, the meaning of words and how words can be used. At one time
we can clearly tell right or wrong usage of words, but these
decisions may need to be revised with the passage of time.
     </p>
     <p>
Generally, metric units are those defined &ldquo;in the spirit&rdquo;
of the metric system, that emerged in France of the 18th century and
was rapidly adopted by scientists. Metric units are usually based on
reproducible natural phenomena and are usually not part of a system of
comparable units with different magintudes, especially not if the
ratios of these units are not powers of 10. Instead, metric units use
multiplier prefixes that magnify or diminish the value of the unit
by powers of ten.
     </p>
     <p>
Conversely, customary units are in the spirit of the middle age as
most of them can be traced back into a time around the 10th century,
some are even older from the Roman and Babylonian empires. Most
customary units are based on the average size of human anatomical or
botanic structures (e.g., foot, ell, fathom, grain, rod) and come in
series of comparable units with ratios 1/2, 1/4, 1/12, 1/16, and
others. Thus all customary units are non-metric
     </p>
     <p>
Not all units from ISO&nbsp;1000 are metric as degree, minute and second of
plane angle are non-metric as well as minute, hour, day, month, and
year. The second is a metric unit because it is a part of the SI
basis, although it used to be part of a series of customary units
(originating in the Babylonian era).
     </p>
     <p>
Furthermore, for a unit to be metric it must be a quantity on a ratio
scale where multiplication and division with scalars are defined.  The
<emph>Comit&eacute; Consultatif d'Unit&eacute;s</emph> (CCU) decided
in February 1995 that SI prefixes may be used with the degree
Celsius. This statement has not been made explicitly before. This is
an unfortunate decision because difference-scale units like the degree
Celsius have no multiplication operation, so that the prefix value
could be multiplied with the unit. Instead the prefix at non-ratio
units scales the measurement value. One dekameter is 10 times of a
meter, but there is no meaning to 10 times of 1&nbsp;&deg;C in the
same way as 30&nbsp;&deg;C are not 3 times as much as
10&nbsp;&deg;C. See <pref from="para-special"/> on how &TUCUM; finds a
way to accommodate this different use of prefixes at units such as the
degree Celsius, bel or neper.

Except for the rule on curly braces (<pref ref="para-curly"/>), the

(<pref from="para-underscore" to="para-apostrophe"/>) because users
just use the symbols defined in the tables. Hence, style rules do not
affect conformance to &TUCUM;. New submissions of unit atoms, however,
must conform to the style rules.

Customary units are defined in &TUCUM; in order to accommodate

Since prefixes have a scalar value that multiplies the unit atom, a
unit must at least have a defined multiplication operation with a
scalar in order to be a candidate for the metric predicate. All proper
units are candidates for the metric property, special units are no
such candidates.
        </p>
        <p>
The <emph>Comit&eacute; Consultatif d'Unit&eacute;s</emph> (CCU)
decided in February 1995 that any SI prefix may be used with degree
Celsius. This statement has not been made explicitly before. This is
an unfortunate decision because difference-scale units like the degree
Celsius have no multiplication operation, so that the prefix value
could be multiplied with the unit. Instead the prefix at non-ratio
units scales the measurement value. One wonders why the CGPM keeps the
Celsius temperature in the SI as it is superfluous and in a unique way
incoherent with the SI.

but as an effect the semantics of &TUCUM; made all arbitrary units 
commensurable. Since version 1.7 of &TUCUM; it is no longer possible to
convert or compare arbitrary units with any other arbitrary unit.

The case insensitive prefix symbols are slightly different from those
defined by ISO&nbsp;2955 and ANSI&nbsp;X3.50, where &ldquo;giga-,&rdquo;
&ldquo;tera-,&rdquo; and &ldquo;peta-&rdquo; have been
&ldquo;<code>G</code>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<code>T</code>,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<code>PE</code>.&rdquo; &TUCUM; has a larger set of unit atoms
and needs to prevent more name conflicts. Tera and giga have a second
letter to be safe in the future. The change of
&ldquo;<code>PE</code>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<code>PT</code>&rdquo; would
be the way to go for ISO&nbsp;2955 which currently has a name conflict
(among others) with peta-volt and pico-electronvolt.

The new prefixes &ldquo;yotta-,&rdquo; &ldquo;zetta-,&rdquo;
&ldquo;yocto-,&rdquo; and &ldquo;zepto-&rdquo; that were adopted by
the 19th CGPM (1990) have a second letter &lquo;A&rquo; and
&lquo;O&rquo; resp. to avoid current and future conflicts and to
disambiguate among themselves. The other submultiples
&ldquo;micro-&rdquo; to &ldquo;atto-&rdquo; are represented by a
single letter to keep with the tradition.

As can be seen the base system used to define &TUCUM; is different
from the system used by the <emph>Syst&egrave;me International
d'Unit&eacute;s</emph> (SI) The SI base unit kilogram has been
replaced by gram and the mole has been replaced by the radian that is
defined dimensionless in the SI. Because of the latter change &TUCUM;
is not isomorphic with the SI.
      </p>
      <p>
The replacement of the kilogram is trivial. In order to bring syntax
and semantics in line we can not have a unit with prefix in the
base. We need a valid unit of mass before we can combine it with the
prefix &ldquo;kilo-&rdquo; This change does not have any effect on the
semantics whatsoever.  The base unit kilogram is one of the oddities
of the SI: if the gram would have been chosen as a base units the CGPM
could have saved the rather annoying exception of the prefixing rules
with the kilogram. At times where we have to multiply the wavelength
of excited krypton-86 atoms by 1650763.73 to yield one meter, it seems
trivial to divide the prototype of the kilogram by thousand to yield a
base unit gram.
      </p>
      <p>
The rationale for removing the mole from the base is that the mole is
essentially a count of particles expressed in a unit of very high
magnitude (Avogadro's number). There is no fundamental difference
between the count of particles and the count other things.
      </p>
      <p>
The radian has been adopted as the base unit of plane angle
<v>&alpha;</v> to facilitate the distinction from the solid angle
<v>&Omega;</v> by the relation <v>&Omega;</v> =
<v>&alpha;</v><sup>2</sup> and to distinguish rotational frequency
<v>f</v> from angular velocity <v>&omega;</v> = 2 <v>&pi;</v> &middot;
rad &middot; <v>f</v>.

The notation &ldquo;<code>10*</code>&rdquo; for powers of ten
originated in the HL7 &ldquo;ISO+&ldquo; extension of ISO&nbsp;2955.
In HL7 the character carat (&lquo;<code>^</code>&rquo;) was thought as
reserved. Since most people would expect to see
&ldquo;<code>10^3</code>&rdquo; for the &ldquo;third power of
ten&rdquo; and might in fact confuse &ldquo;<code>10*3</code>&rdquo;
to mean &ldquo;ten times 3&rdquo;, the symbol using the carat was
later added to &TUCUM;.

The case insensitive symbol for pascal is
&ldquo;<code>PAL</code>&rdquo; which conforms to ISO&nbsp;2955 and prevents
the name conflict between pascal and pico-amp&egrave;re.

Without reference to history, it is difficult to explain that the
degree Celsius is part of the SI, because the degree Celsius is in a
unique way incoherent with the SI, and is even superfluous since the
base unit kelvin measures the same kind of quantity.

In the case sensitive variant the liter is defined both with an upper
case &lquo;<code>L</code>&rdquo; and a lower case
&lquo;<code>l</code>&rquo;. NIST [63 FR 40338] declares the upper case
&lquo;L&rquo; as the preferred symbol for the U.S., while in many other
countries the lower case &lquo;l&rquo; is used. In fact the lower case
&lquo;l&rquo; was in effect since 1879. A hundred years later in 1979
the 16th CGPM decided to adopt the upper case &lquo;L&rquo; as a
second symbol for the liter.  In the case insensitive variant there is
only one symbol defined since there is no difference between upper
case &lquo;L&rquo; and lower case &lquo;l&rquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
The unit &ldquo;are&rdquo; competes with year for the symbol
&ldquo;a&rdquo; not only in ISO&nbsp;2955, and ANSI&nbsp;X3.50, but also in
ISO&nbsp;1000 as stating the official CGPM approved symbols. This is why
the symbol for are is &ldquo;<code>ar</code>&rdquo; in
&TUCUM;. ISO&nbsp;2955 explicitly adds the unit atom
&ldquo;<code>ha</code>&rdquo; for hectare, while &ldquo;hectare&rdquo;
is just the correct spelling of the compositum of &ldquo;hecto&rdquo;
and &ldquo;are&rdquo; and thus would not require a separate unit
atom. Nevertheless, ISO&nbsp;2955 in its case insensitive variant assigns
&ldquo;<code>ARE</code>&rdquo; to the are and
&ldquo;<code>har</code>&rdquo; to the hectare. This is obviously an
anomaly which &TUCUM; will not follow. As a metric unit,
&ldquo;<code>ar</code>&rdquo; can be prefixed with
&ldquo;<code>h</code>&rdquo; to yield &ldquo;<code>har</code>&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 had two different series of symbols for the units of time,
the ones from ISO&nbsp;2955 as adopted by &TUCUM; and the symbols
&ldquo;<code>yr</code>&rdquo; &ldquo;<code>mo</code>&rdquo;
&ldquo;<code>wk</code>&rdquo; &ldquo;<code>hr</code>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<code>sec</code>&rdquo; while &ldquo;<code>d</code>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<code>min</code>&rdquo; were defined twice. &TUCUM; does not
define these synonyms of ISO&nbsp;2955 symbols, but does adopt those units
from ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 that are not part of ISO&nbsp;2955, namely
&ldquo;<code>mo</code>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<code>wk</code>&rdquo; Month
and week are useful units mainly in business or clinical medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
The semantics of the units of time is difficult to capture.  The
difficulties start with the day: There is the sidereal and the solar
day that depend on the earth's rotation. The earth's rotation is
variable during one day and is continually slowing down in the long
run.  The usual subdivisions of the day in 24 hours of 60 minutes and
60 seconds originated in Babylonia. The earth's rotation was too
inexact to measure time, which is why the 11th CGPM (1954) defined the
second based on a standardized historical tropical year (see below)
which was later (13th CGPM 1967-1968) replaced by frequency
measurement. Thus the second came to be the base unit of time and the
day is now 864000&nbsp;s exactly with the <emph>Universal Coordinated
Time</emph> (UTC) adding leap seconds every now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
For the year we have to distinguish the &ldquo;tropical&rdquo; (solar,
sidereal) year from the calendar year. And both are difficult. The
tropical year is the year defined by time the earth travels around the
sun. This is difficult to measure and varies over time.  Around 1900
it was 365.242196&nbsp;d, currently it is 365.242190&nbsp;d and around
2100 it will be 365.242184&nbsp;d.  In addition these durations are
averages. The actual length of each year may vary by several minutes
due to the gravitational influence of other planets. Thus there is
quite a high uncertainty already in the fourth decimal digit.
      </p>
      <p>
The calendar year is also difficult because there is the Julian
calendar (Sosigenes of Alexandria and Julius Caesar, 45 BC) with a
slightly too long year of 365.25&nbsp;d that causes the calendar to be
one day ahead of the tropical year in 128 years. The Gregorian
calendar (Christopher Clavius 1537-1612 and Pope Gregory XIII
1545-1563) leaves out three leap years in 400 years (let <v>n</v> be the
year number, the leap year is dropped if <v>n</v> mod 100 = 0 but not <v>n</v>
mod 400 = 0.) The Gregorian mean year is thus 365.2425&nbsp;d.
This leap year arithmetic seems to be too much even for astronomers,
which is why the light year ends up being defined based on the Julian
year [NIST Sp.&nbsp;Pub. 811, 1995 Edition]. For this reason &TUCUM;
defines Tropical, Julian and Gregorian year by means of subscripts,
but assigns the default year symbol to the Julian year.
      </p>
      <p>
The week is 7 days, this is a biblic truth we can count on (it is
actually quite plausible that the week of seven days originated in
Babylonia and entered Jewish tradition during the Babylonian exile.)
      </p>
      <p>
The difficulty continues with the month. The lunar (so called
&ldquo;synodal&rdquo; month is variable. Around 1900 it was
29.5305886&nbsp;d currently it is 29.5305889&nbsp;d and in 2100 it
will be 29.5305891&nbsp;d, which we fixate in the 5th decimal digit
with a considerable uncertainty. The calendar month is difficult
because of the uneven distribution of days in a month over the year,
and because of the two different calendar years. But we will usually
use the mean calendar month, which is the Julian calendar year divided
by 12.
      </p>
      <p>
As a conclusion, great care has to be taken when the &ldquo;customary
units&rdquo; of time are used to measure time. The SI has fixated the
second which should be used whenever accuracy is required. For
business purposes the Julian calendar is sufficient especially since
the notion of the Work-Day (vs. Holiday) is more important than the
imprecision over 128 years.

Although the CGPM &ldquo;accepts&rdquo; only very few CGS units &ldquo;for use with
the SI,&rdquo; CGS units are proper metric units. CGS units are still used
in many physiological laboratories and in clinical diagnostics (e.g.,
cardiology). In addition CGS units acquired a special dignity as this
was the system of units used by the great physicists of the early 20th
century, Albert Einstein, Max Planck, and many others who worked on
the scientific revolution that had quite a cultural impact.
      </p>
      <p>
The CGS system defined electric and magnetic phenomena differently
which is why the units named &ldquo;oersted&rdquo; and &ldquo;maxwell&rdquo; have no
proper SI counterpart. This table was compiled from various sources
and is not complete and not very systematic. We therefore welcome
suggestions and advice as to how this table could be completed.

    <head>Customary Unit Atoms</head>

    <comment>
      <p>
Customary units have once been used all over Europe. Units were taken
from nature: anatomical structures (e.g., arm, foot, finger),
botanical objects (e.g., grains of various sorts, rod), or processes
of everyday life (e.g., amount of land one could plow in a morning,
the length of 1000 steps, an hour of walking, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
Many of these units can be traced back in history to the Romans
(mile), Greeks (carat) and even more ancient times. It is thus no
wonder that this heritage was in some way ordered. Indeed, one finds
the same names for units used in different countries and most of these
units where divided into smaller or multiplied to larger units in the
same way.
      </p>
      <p>
For example, there was the foot (de. &ldquo;Fu&sharps;&rdquo;
fr. &ldquo;pied&rdquo; nl. &ldquo;voet&rdquo;) that was divided into
12 inches (de. &ldquo;Zoll&rdquo; fr. &ldquo;pouce&rdquo;). An inch
was divided into 12 lines (de. &ldquo;Linie&rdquo;
fr. &ldquo;ligne&rdquo; ). Two feet was one ell
(de. &ldquo;Elle&rdquo; da. &ldquo;Alen&rdquo;
sv. &ldquo;Aln&rdquo;). The ell was, however, not very popular in
England, as opposed to the rest of Europe. Conversely, the yard is
hard to find elsewhere, aside from the Argentinian &ldquo;vara.&rdquo;
But it is perhaps no accident that the meter ended up as the 40 &mult;
10<sup>-6</sup> of an earth's meridian, which is approximately one
yard (43.7 &mult; 10<sup>-6</sup>). The rod (de. &ldquo;Rute&rdquo;
fr. &ldquo;perche&rdquo; nl. &ldquo;roede&rdquo;
sv. &ldquo;st&aring;ng&rdquo;) was very popular all over Europe and so
was the fathom (de. &ldquo;Klafter&rdquo;).
      </p>
      <p>
The square rod (de. &ldquo;Quadratrute&rdquo;  fr. &ldquo;perche-carr&eacute;e&rdquo; 
nl. &ldquo;vierkante-roede&rdquo;  was mainly used to measure land. The acre as
the legendary land to sow in one morning (or day) is also widespread
(de. &ldquo;Morgen, Tagwerk, Acker&rdquo;  fr. &ldquo;arpent&rdquo;  sv. &ldquo;tunnland&rdquo; ,
although the exact amount in square rod varies considerably from
region to region. Interestingly, even the special purpose measures
such as the &ldquo;hand&rdquo; for measuring horses have international equivalents
(de. &ldquo;faust&rdquo;).
      </p>
      <p>
One can indeed say that there was once a &ldquo;<emph>syst&egrave;me
international d'unit&eacute;s coutumi&egrave;res</emph>&ldquo; but the
magnitudes of the units were not standardized internationally. Of
course, Great Britain had the most impact in standardizing the
customary system, because of its colonies, including its most
important colony, America. However, after the customary units were
established in the U.S. a major reform took place through the British
Weights and Measures Act of 1824. For instance, Queen Anne's wine
Gallon of 231 cubic inches, still used in the U.S., was discarded
then, and the older bushel was standardized differently in Great
Britain.  Other deviations between the English and U.S. measures are
due to various alignments with the metric system. Thus, in the U.S.,
the yard was standardized as 3600/3937&nbsp;m and the inch was
2.540005&nbsp;cm while in England the inch was still 2.539998&nbsp;cm.
      </p>
      <p>
In 1959 major parts of the U.S. and British system of customary units
were standardized internationally, again aligned to the metric system
which is why the international yard is 0.9144&nbsp;m exactly and the
nautical mile became 1852&nbsp;m exactly. However, traditional
subdivisions and multiples have not been abolished in favor of the
international standard. Furthermore the old U.S. standard for the yard
is still legally used for land surveying.
      </p>
      <p>
Conclusively, there are different systems of customary units that are
in use today. These systems use the same names for units that have
different equivalents in the metric system, because the customary
systems are based on different reference quantities but multiples and
subdivisions of the reference quantities are very similar, though with
notable exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
In the following tables we tried to give the original definitions to
the customary units. This means in general that the references to the
metric system are as few as possible, with most of the units of one
system defined as multiples and subdivisions of one reference unit.
      </p>
      <p>
We use the subscript notation to disambiguate units with same names in
the different systems. Subscript notation means, for instance that if
the print symbol for foot is &ldquo;ft&rdquo; we use subscripts to
distinguish the international foot &ldquo;ft<sub>i</sub>&rdquo; the
U.S. survey foot &ldquo;ft<sub>us</sub>&rdquo; and the British
Imperial foot &ldquo;ft<sub>br</sub>&rdquo; We do not actually list
print symbols for customary units, because there seems to be no
standard for it, and because defining print symbols is out of scope of
&TUCUM;. However, we presume that subscripts be used to disambiguate
whatever print symbols are being used. According to <pref
from="para-underscore"/>, &TUCUM; uses the underscore to denote those
subscripts, and also encloses the entire unit atom into square
brackets. Hence, the symbols for the international foot, the
U.S. survey foot and the British Imperial foot are defined as
&ldquo;<code>[ft_i]</code>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<code>[ft_us]</code>,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<code>[ft_br]</code>&rdquo; respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
Prospective users of &TUCUM; may be disappointed by the fact that
there are many different symbols for foot and inch defined but all of
them have a subscript and thus none of them are equal to the
ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 symbols. We considered to define default symbols for
customary units, where, e.g., the common units of length (foot, inch)
would default to the international customary units, while mass units
(pound, ounce) would default to the avoirdupois system. However,
because the customary system is quite complex, and units by the same
names can differ by more than 20%, defining defaults will probably
cause even more confusion. There is no denial: a gallon is not just a
gallon and a pound is not just a pound, this is the disadvantage of
dealing with a unit system of medieval origin.

In general the international customary units are effective in the
U.S. and in Great Britain since 1959. We are unsure, however, about
this in countries that formerly or at present belong to the
Commonwealth. We therefore appreciate advice and reference to original
sources on this transition. Conceivably other countries may have made
exceptions in the transition to the international definitions of
customary units, such as the U.S. where the old definitions have been
retained for the purpose of land surveying.
      </p>
      <p>
It is not quite clear exactly what units the international customary
system comprises. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica
[<emph>British Imperial System. Britannica Online</emph>], the rod was
removed in Great Britain in 1963. Since the definition of the acre is
based on the rod, we did not include rod and acre in the international
customary system. In the U.S. the acre is still defined on the older
U.S. customary system as of 1893.
      </p>
      <p>
In general, we did not include special customary units of area and
volume in <tabref ref="intcust"/>, since these are still used
differently in the U.S. Special symbols such as square inch and cubic
foot have been included according to ANSI&nbsp;X3.50. Generally the
&ldquo;square-&rdquo; and &ldquo;cubic-&rdquo; prefixes are
unnecessary in ISO&nbsp;2955 and ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 and are deprecated by
&TUCUM;. We placed the board foot, cord and circular mil into the
international table because these units are suggested by
ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 but we were not sure in what sense they are still
used.  We did, however, not include the square mile in the
international table because in the U.S. measurements in square miles
are most likely based on the survey mile that is part of the older
system, see <pref ref="para-us-lengths"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
The circular mil is exactly the area of a circle with a diameter of
one mil. One mil, in turn, equals 1/1000 inch (&ldquo;mil&rdquo; is the
etymological equivalent of &ldquo;milli-inch&rdquo; ) The mil has been
defined in <tabref ref="intcust"/> to support the exact definition of
the circular mil.
      </p>
      <p>
ANSI X3.50 does not define a symbol for the &ldquo;hand,&rdquo; but this unit is
mentioned in the table given by the Encyclopedia Britannica. The hand
is used in measuring the height of horses from foot to shoulder. It
was probably not subject to the internationalization of customary
units. Any advice as whether the hand is used based on an older
British or U.S. definition is appreciated.

After the 1959 international agreement changed the definition of the yard in the US to be 0.9144 m exactly, surveyors and civil engineers complained that voluminous legacy surveys and so forth used the previous definition of (1200/3937) m and that this change would be disruptive. So, by statute, Congress created a survey foot of (1200/3937) m (the old 1893 Mendenhall Order definition). Thus, by statute, miles used in surveying are referred to as statute miles of 5280 survey feet each. The fathom, rod, and furlong are likewise based on the survey foot.
			</p>
      <p>
According to NIST, the acre as normally used in the U.S. is defined
in terms of U.S. survey lengths, and not in terms of the
international customary system.  This older U.S. customary system of
survey lengths is still used for geodesic measurements.

The older British Imperial system is predominantly of historical
interest. However, it may be that some former members of the
Commonwealth have retained this system after 1959, when the unified
international definitions where established, and after 1963, when the
British system was revised in England.
      </p>
      <p> 
The chain was proposed by Edmund Gunter in England of the 17th
century. It is possible that Gunter's chain and Ramden's chain are
related to other European traditional units such as the English
&ldquo;rope&rdquo; (measuring 20 feet) or the old German
&ldquo;Landseil&rdquo; (measuring 52 ells or 104 feet) named after
ropes or chains that could be spanned in order to measure land. The
difference in the definitions of those units is no surprise as there
is nothing that restricts a chain or rope to a particular
length. However, these units are still similar in magnitude.

The U.S. fluid volumes have been defined based on Queen Anne's wine
gallon which was in turn defined exactly as 231 cubic inch. Although
we used international inch, we are not sure what inch definition is
actually used for defining the exact size of a U.S. gallon. However,
the differences between the various inches are minimal, even when
raised to the 3rd power (i.e., the difference between the U.S. inch
and the British Imperial inch remains in the sixth decimal digit.)
      </p>
      <p>
Dry measures are based on the bushel (corn bushel), originally defined
in 1701 as &ldquo;any round measure with a plain and even bottom, being
18.5 inches wide throughout and 8 inches deep.&rdquo; This definition,
being (18.5/2)<sup>2</sup> &pi; &mult; 8 = 2150.42017138221... cubic
inch was later truncated to 2150.42 cubic inch exactly. At times the
bushel was closely related with the Winchester gallon (corn gallon),
which has been mentioned as an historical curiosity.
      </p>

ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 defines symbols for the units cup, tablespoon and teaspoon
which are predominantly used in cooking recipes but also in practical
medicine. Similar units can often be found in European cook books, but
are usually translated into metric units outside the U.S. For
practical medicine these are still very handy units to give
instructions to patients.

The British Weights and Measures Act of 1824 removed the medieval
distinction between wine and grain measures and defined one unified
system of volumes based on a new Gallon that was defined similarly as
the metric unit liter: &ldquo;10 imperial pounds weight of distilled
water weighed in air against brass weights with the water and the air
at a temperature of 62 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer and with
the barometer at 30 inches.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
With the current definition of the gallon as 277.421 cubic inches
(approximately) and a density of water of 0.99878&nbsp;kg/l according
to NIST data, the inch must have been approximately 2.5371&nbsp;cm at
that time. Because of this difficulty with the original definition of
the British gallon we based the British Imperial volumes on the gallon
for which there is an exact metric equivalence, according to NIST,
which provides usually well researched data.
      </p>
      <p>
Note that the subdivisions of the British Imperial system of volumes
differs from the U.S. system of fluid volumes between gill and fluid
ounce: in the British system 1&nbsp;oz&nbsp;fl equals 1/5&nbsp;gill where
in the U.S. system 1&nbsp;oz&nbsp;fl equals 1/4&nbsp;gill. Thus, although
the British system starts out with a 20% larger gallon, the British
fluid ounce, fluid dram and minim are 4% smaller than the U.S. units
with the same name.

The avoirdupois system is used in the U.S. as well as in countries that
use the British Imperial system. Avoirdupois is the default system of
mass units used for all goods that &ldquo;have weight&rdquo;
(fr. <emph>avoir du poids</emph>). Interestingly all three systems of
weight are based on the same grain of barley, standardized to
64.79891&nbsp;mg exactly [NIST].

The troy system originates in Troyes, a City in the Champagne (France)
that hosted a major European fair. The troy system was later used for
measuring precious metals. The World Monetary Fund valued all
currencies against the troy ounce of gold at least until the 1960s
(advice appreciated). The troy ounce is still used in worldwide trade
with gold, even in countries that otherwise use metric units
(de. &ldquo;feinunze&rdquo;). The troy system retains the original Roman
subdivision of the pound in 12 ounces. The Roman <emph>uncia</emph> was &ldquo;one
twelfth&rdquo; of a <emph>libra</emph> (hence the symbol &ldquo;lb&rdquo; for the pound),
just as the inch (also originating from la. &ldquo;libra&rdquo;  is one twelfth
of a foot. The subdivision of 12 ounces/inches per pound/foot and 2
foot per ell (la. &ldquo;cubit&rdquo;  apparently originated in the ancient
Egypt and was carried on by the Greeks and Romans into the medieval
Europe. However, there was always an ambiguity such that the
subdivision of 1/12 could become 1/16 and vice versa, hence the
avoirdupois ounce of 1/16 pound.
      </p>
      <p>
Note also that the troy pound was abolished in England on January 6,
1879 [Jacques J. Proot, <emph>Anglo-Saxon weights &amp; measures</emph>, URL:

Note that some U.S. pharmacies still use this system of apothecaries'
weights when measuring the amount of drugs. This system is very
different from the avoirdupois system though based on the same
grain. The apothecaries' dram is more than twice as much as the
avoirdupois dram, the ounce is still 10% greater than the avoirdupois
ounce while the pound is 20% less than the avoirdupois pound. The
apothecaries' system, just as the troy system, keeps the original
Roman subdivision of an ounce (la. &ldquo;uncia&rdquo;  to be 1/12 pound
(la. &ldquo;libra&rdquo;). Hence is the apothecaries' pound about 22% smaller
than the avoirdupois pound, while its subdivisions are greater than
the respective avoirdupois subdivisions (ounce 10%, dram 119%). This
difference in the weight systems is the most important reason why
ANSI&nbsp;X3.50 should not be applied in medicine, where both systems are
being used and therefore misinterpretations are inevitable.

There are three systems of typesetter's lengths in use today:
Fran&ccedilla;cois-Ambroise Didot (1730-1804), a publisher in Paris,
invented this system based on the traditional subdivisions of the
customary units: 1 line was 1/12 inch and 1/6 line was one
point. Henceforth the size of letters were measured in point. However,
the Didot system is based on the <emph>pouce</emph>, i.e. the french
inch, which, just as the English inch, is 1/12 <emph>pied</emph>
(foot). But the French foot was about 6.5% greater than the British
Imperial foot. In the Anglo-American realm the typesetter's point was
based on the British Imperial inch, with the same
subdivisions. However, in the type foundries' industry the original
definition of a point drifted apart, and in the late 19th century
U.S. type foundries reestablished a slightly (0.375%) greater standard
point. This point made its way back to the British. However, recently,
the computer typesetting industry readjusted the point to its original
size of 1/72 inch. All three systems, however, are still being used
today.

The degree Fahrenheit was missing in ANSI&nbsp;X3.50. HL7's
&ldquo;ISO+/ANS+&rdquo; code defined the degree Fahrenheit under the
symbol &ldquo;<code>DEGF</code>&rdquo; which is reflected here. This
is the reason why &TUCUM; does not define a new symbol
&ldquo;<code>Fah</code>&rdquo; similar to
&ldquo;<code>Cel</code>&rdquo; of 
ISO&nbsp;2955 for the degree Celsius.
      </p>
      <p>
Defining precise semantics for legacy units for &ldquo;quantity of
heat&rdquo; is difficult. The many variants of these units are
frequently confused because there is not just a calorie and not just a
British thermal unit. The different calories usually being used vary
by 1% but the confusion can result in an error as high as 100000%!
Thus, if exactness and non-ambiguity is important one should use the
joule to report amounts of heat, just like for any other energy and
work kind-of-quantities.
      </p>
      <p>
The gram-calorie, sometimes called &ldquo;small calorie&rdquo; is
defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1
gram of Water from 14.5&nbsp;&deg;C to 15.5&nbsp;&deg;C. According to
<emph>Encyclopedia Britannica</emph>, this is the calorie most often used in
engineering. There is also a less frequently used gram-calorie at
19.5&nbsp;&deg;C to 20.5&nbsp;&deg;C and a mean calorie that is 1/100
of the amount of heat required to raise the temperature from
0&nbsp;&deg;C to 100&nbsp;&deg;C. The <emph>International Table</emph>
calorie is defined by the <emph>International Conference on the
Properties of Steam</emph> (1956) and is used in steam engineering. In
chemistry a &ldquo;thermochemical&rdquo; calorie is used for reaction
enthalpies.
      </p>
      <p>
To complete the confusion, there is also a kilogram-calorie (&ldquo;large
calorie&rdquo; , that has a similar definition based on a kilogram
instead of a gram of water. This kilocalorie has also been called
&ldquo;calorie&rdquo; in the sloppy speech of everyday life about
food. U.S. &ldquo;Nutrition Facts&rdquo; that label almost every
American food say &ldquo;Calories: xxx&rdquo; The <emph>International
Union of Nutritional Sciences</emph> recommends using either the joule
or a kilocalorie based on the thermochemical calorie. Because of a
perceived popular demand &TUCUM; defines the nutrition Calorie as
&ldquo;<code>Cal</code>&rdquo; with the conventional capital first
letter. For the case insensitive variant of &TUCUM;, the symbol is
enclosed in square brackets (&ldquo;<code>[CAL]</code>&rdquo;).
      </p>
      <p>
Only the International Table calorie and the thermochemical calorie
have exact definitions. To give some guidance in the confusing plenty
of different calories, &TUCUM; defines a default symbol
&ldquo;<code>cal</code>&rdquo; as an alias for the thermochemical
calorie, because the calorie is mostly used today in medicine and
biochemistry. On the other hand, we consider engineers smart enough to
select the precise calorie they mean.
      </p>
      <p>
Similar to the calories, various &ldquo;British Thermal Unit&rdquo;
(Btu) are defined and the confusion continues. One Btu is defined as
the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of one
avoirdupois pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit beginning from
various temperatures (39&nbsp;&deg;F, 59&nbsp;&deg;F, or
60&nbsp;&deg;F). There is also the International Table Btu and the
thermochemical Btu. Just as with the calorie we define a default
symbol &ldquo;<code>Btu</code>&rdquo; as an alias for the
thermochemical Btu.

Clinical medicine all over the world still uses &nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg to
measure arterial blood pressure, and often the instruments used are
real mercury columns. Likewise, the central venous blood pressure is
often measured using simple water columns which is very practical for
the routine. The units &nbsp;m&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O and &nbsp;m&nbsp;Hg
are metric units even though they are &ldquo;not accepted&rdquo; for
use with the SI for quite a while. Although more and more hospitals in
Europe switch to using the pascal to measure partial pressures in
blood gas analysis, the older units will not vanish any time soon.
      </p>
      <p>
In the U.S. the inch is sometimes used instead of the millimeter, and
because the inch is non-metric the inch of mercury or water columns is
non-metric as well.
      </p>
      <p>
The peripheral vascular resistance unit is the vascular resistance on
which a perfusion pressure of 1&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg causes a flow of
1&nbsp;ml/s.
      </p>
      <p>
The &ldquo;mesh&rdquo; occurs in the NIST Guide to the SI. It seems like it is
the customary counterpart of the diopter.

The unit &ldquo;charri&egrave;re&rdquo; originates from a French manufacturer of
medical instruments by that name. One charri&egrave;re is the gauge of a
catheter with a circumference of approximately 1&nbsp;mm 
such that it is by convention exactly one third of a millimeter. 
In the U.S. the charri&egrave;re is simply called &ldquo;french&rdquo;

Note that &UCUM; versions prior to 1.9 defined this unit as 1/&pi;, this use,

A drop is a variable amount of fluid and depends on the device and
technique used to produce the drop and on the physical properties of
the fluid. This is similar to units like cup, tablespoon, and teaspoon
that depend on the spoon or cup and are not exact either. However, in
clinical medicine medication is dispensed by drops and unlike a
&ldquo;tablet&rdquo; a drop refers to a real physical kind of quantity, volume,
though not very exact.
			</p>
			<note>

Note that &UCUM; versions prior to 1.9 defined this unit as mL/12, this use, 
however this was not common use of the unit.  
This is why the definition has been corrected instead of adding another one.
Typically it is stated as mL/20.
Original research using a 20 mL syringe filled to 5 mL shows that 
1 mL has 25 drops of water, 
when tensides are added, the number goes up to 45. 
A saturated saline solution required 30 and plant oil 35. 
The speed of dropping, pressure and position of the syringe or the lumen of the outlet, 
open or partially clogged with wax, 
did not have a significant influence on the number of drops.
While the original research suggests that the division should be by 25 or more, we use the common notion.
It is discouraged to use the drop as any standard unit.

The Hounsfield unit is a unit of X-ray attenuation used in evaluating
CT scans. It is defined on an interval scale where air is -1000 HF,
water is 0 HF and bone is +1000 HF. Any advice as to how this unit can
be related to metric units of radiant intensity decremence is
appreciated.

We have always pointed out that the homeopathic teaching takes potency
not as equivalent to dilution and the C and X series would not equate
to each other in the strictly numerical manner. Homeopathic potency
includes the &ldquo;agitation&rdquo; (a vigorous shaking) that needs
to occur in every step of the dilluting process. Therefore as of April 2010, 
the homeopathic units are declared "arbitrary units", that is, they 
are no longer convertible. Therefore, also, we discontinue defining them
using the dilution functions. The dilution functions sometimes cause
truly astronomical values, leading to overflow conditions, e.g. in 
such potencies as 30 C or 100 X or 10 M, which do actually occur in
homeopathics that are on the market. The previous units continue to
exist as "retired", but their symbols now have a prime (apostrophe) in
them.

The amount of electrolytes (including acids and bases) is often
reported as <emph>equivalents</emph> instead of amount of substance. This
habit originates in the measuring technique of titration. &TUCUM;
does not endorse using equivalents. We rather recommend to calculate
the proper amount of substance after titration, so that
1&nbsp;eq of Na<sup>+</sup> ions is 1&nbsp;mol, but
1&nbsp;eq of Ca<sup>++</sup> ions is
0.5&nbsp;mol. The problem with equivalents is that the measurement
results are difficult to compare because their magnitude depends on
the degree of ionization of the substance. That is to say, the meaning
of equivalents depend not only on the substance, but also on the state
that the substance is in. For example, in iron we have to distinguish
Fe<sup>2+</sup> from Fe<sup>3+</sup>, so that no one can be sure how much 1&nbsp;eq
of iron really is.
      </p>
      <p>
Degrees of acidity are normally measured as &ldquo;the pH value&rdquo; that is
the negative decadic logarithmus of the concentration of free protons
(or hydronium ions) expressed in 1&nbsp;mol/l. Usually the pH value
is considered a dimensionless quantity. With the semantics of special
units (<pref from="para-special"/>). &TUCUM; can link the pH value tighter to the system
of proper units. Thus &ldquo;<code>[pH]</code>&rdquo; is defined as a unit symbol with
the corresponding unit 1&nbsp;mol/l. This allows conversions between
pH and concentrations, and---because &TUCUM; identifies the mole with
the Avogadro number---can be converted to an absolute number of
protons: for example, pH 7.4 converts instantly to 0.04&nbsp;&mu;mol/l
and approximately 23975 protons per picoliter.
      </p>
      <p>
The unit osmol as the amount of dissolved particles is to be used with
caution because it interferes with &ldquo;osmolar&rdquo; which is the amount of
dissolved particles per liter.
      </p>
      <p>
The gram-percent (g%) is a metric unit that has the same origin as
%vol. Originally it was a dimensionless quantity expressing a ratio of
two masses and thus equal to 1/100&nbsp;g/g. Because water is the most
important solvent in biochemistry and 1&nbsp;g of a solution in water
has a volume of approximately 1&nbsp;ml, the meaning of the unit
1&nbsp;g% drifted towards 1/100&nbsp;g/ml and farther off to
1&nbsp;g/dl. That way, the unit 1&nbsp;g% regained a proper dimension
(mass concentration, <dim>M</dim>/<dim>L</dim><sup>3</sup>). Most
often it is used as 1&nbsp;mg% = 1&nbsp;mg/dl but all other SI
prefixes are possible.
      </p>
      <p>
The Svedberg unit S is used to classify macromolecules (e.g.,
ribosomes) in different phases of a centrifugate.
      </p>
      <p>
The units &ldquo;high power field&rdquo; (HPF) and &ldquo;low power field&rdquo; (LPF) are
used in microscopic analysis mostly of urine sediments. These units
are used in semi-quantitative estimations of the abundance of things
like crystals, bacteria or red and white blood cells. The number of
the objects of interest is counted in one view field in the microscope
with a 10 times (low) or 100 times (high) magnifying objective lens
and then reported as the number per LPF or per HPF
respectively. Obviously the number of objects seen depends on the way
the slide is prepared: the amount of emulgate dropped, its initial
dilution, and the way the drop is smeared. These preparations of the
slides are usually carried out with great routine but little
exactness, hence LPF and HPF can hardly relate to any exact and
meaningful volume.
      </p>
      <p>
The best we could do is to define LPF and HPF as areas of the viewed
field. However, the area of the field varies with the kind of eyepiece
used in the microscope. The so called &ldquo;field number&rdquo; of
the eyepiece, i.e., the diameter of the view area is typically between
18&nbsp;mm and 25&nbsp;mm which is divided by the magnification of the
objective lense to yield the actual field diameter <v>d</v>. Because the
area <v>A</v> = &pi;&nbsp;d<sup>2</sup>, the LPF can be anywhere
between 2.5&nbsp;mm^2 and 5&nbsp;mm^2 and the HPF between
0.025&nbsp;mm^2 and 0.05&nbsp;mm^2. Because of this inexactness, we
define LPF and HPF as dimensionless quantities with magnitudes that
reflect the ratio of the view areas, i.e. 100:1. This allows at least
to convert between numbers per LPF and per HPF and vice versa.
      </p>

The unit &ldquo;U&rdquo; of enzymatic activity was defined in 1964 by
the <emph>International Union of Biochemistry</emph> as the catalytic
activity that catalyzes the transformation of 1&nbsp;&mu;mol of the
substrate per minute. This unit is defined so that normal biological
enzyme activities are in the range of 1&nbsp;U-100&nbsp;U. This unit
could not be adopted by the CGPM because it violates the style rules
of the SI, i.e. &ldquo;unit&rdquo; is a very indistinctive word,
&ldquo;U&rdquo; is a capital letter, and the definition is not
coherent with the SI. 
      </p>
      <p>
An SI-coherent unit katal 1&nbsp;kat = 1&nbsp;mol/s, had been proposed
for adoption into the SI over 30 years ago and was finally adopted by
the CGPM in 1999. However, perhaps because the unit katal is 7 orders
of magnitudes greater than normal catalytic activities, in practice
the katal has not gained much in popularity over the unit
&ldquo;U&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
In its 1999 decision to add the katal to the SI, the CGPM explicitly
&ldquo;recommends that when the katal is used, the measurand be
specified by reference to the measurement procedure; the measurement
procedure must identify the indicator reaction.&rdquo;  The general
problem with catalytic activities is that these heavily depend not
only on the substance but on many side-conditions, such as
temperature, acidity of the solution, presence or absence of
cofactors, inhibitors or activators, and the amount of substrate.
Particularly a catalytic activity measured <emph>in vitro</emph> says
little about the activity <emph>in vivo</emph>. Hence the use of katal
alone without specifying exactly the measurement method, is not 
sufficient to improve comparability of the measurement of catalytic 
substances.
      </p>
      <p>
Because of the influence of the measurement method, results of
biologic activity measurement cannot usually be converted. This is a
particular problem with the many named arbitrary units that are still
used. &TUCUM; initially defined all arbitrary units as
dimensionless. But since this leads to the false conclusion that all
arbitrary units are the same, the &UCUM; now accounts for arbitrary units
using a special flag. When a unit is marked as arbitrary, it is 
isolated from all other units, and no result can be converted from 
and to that unit (See <pref ref="para-arbitrary"/>).

The unit &ldquo;TCID<sub>50</sub>&rdquo; expresses the result of
quantifying an infectious agent in tissue culture. It is a titer, expressing the
highest dilution of the specimen which produces a cytopathic effect in
50% of the cell cultures or wells inoculated.

      <p>
The unit &ldquo;FFU&rdquo; measures viral infectivity in a sensitive
assay in cell culture, for example, using immunofocus or vital dyes
technology.  For example, the titer is determined by visualizing
infected areas of a cell monolayer by probing with virus-specific
antibodies and results are recorded as FFU/ml.

EDITORIAL NOTE: This method needs to be further investigated to
determine a quantitative model which relates that would relate 1 BAU
with a standardized amount of substance of the standardized allergenic

for many of the arbitrary units listed already. In a future revision a
stronger formalized metrologic model will be added to this

The unit &ldquo;IR&rdquo; has been defined to measure the
allergenicity of an allergen extract. The allergen extract contains
100 IR/ml when, on a skin prick-test using a Stallerpoint&reg;, it induces
a wheal diameter of 7 mm in 30 patients sensitized to this allergen,
(geometric mean).  The cutaneous reactivity of these patients is
simultaneously demonstrated by a positive skin prick-test to either 9
% codeine phosphate or 10 mg/ml histamine. The IR unit of Stallergenes
is not comparable to the units used by other allergen manufacturers.

future, we will include a manufacturer abbreviation in the unit symbol.

      <p>
The unit &ldquo;Amb a 1 U&rdquo; is an arbitrary unit for the
amount of Amb a 1, a 38 kD glycoprotein that is the major allergen in
short ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) pollen allergen extracts. The
amount of Amb a 1 units are determined by an in-vitro comparison of a
test short ragweed extract to a FDA CBER Amb a 1 reference standard.
Amb a 1 is the up-to-date term for the short ragweed pollen allergen
that was originally described as Antigen E. They are
synonyms. Although Antigen E is no longer used in the scientific
literature, its meaning is unambiguous. The manufacturers are still
licensed to use Antigen E as the designation. Therefore, Amb a 1 U =
AgE U.  There is an empiric relationship between Amb a 1 U and BAU
(350 Amb a 1 U/mL = 100,000 BAU/mL). It was based on studies done
decades ago on 15 study subjects. FDA's CBER considered mandating a
conversion to BAU/mL in the labeling of short ragweed pollen products,
based on AgE content, but this was never implemented.  CBER provides
two US standard reagents to manufacturers for their determination of
Amb a 1 content, a reference standard and a reference serum. The assay
used is a radial immunodiffusion assay (RID). Solid references
discussing the relationship between Antigen E U/mL/Amb a 1 U/mL and
micrograms of Antigen E U/mL/Amb a 1/mL are being researched.
      </p>

      <p>
EDITORIAL NOTE: The University of Texas' Structural Database of
Allergenic Proteins (SDAP) contains close to 1000 allergens,
isoallergens. Comparing the prospect of thousands of such special
units for every allergen, one begins to appreciate even the
metrologically complex BAU unit.
      </p>

      <p>
The unit &ldquo;PNU&rdquo; is defined as follows: 1 PNU/ml is
equivalent to 1 x 10-5 mg of nitrogen determined to be in the material
precipitated from 1 ml of allergenic extract by phosphotungstic acid
(micro-Kjeldahl method). Typically, 1 mg of protein nitrogen equals
100,000 PNU. The unit &ldquo;PNU&rdquo; is an old protein unit
unrelated to SI units. Several hundred products, from several
manufacturers, are labeled in PNUs, and a switch to SI units for
protein content is impractical.
      </p>      

      <p>
The unit &ldquo;Lf&rdquo; is called the &ldquo;Limit of
Flocculation&rdquo; or &ldquo;limes flocculationis&rdquo;. It is based
on an antigen-antibody precipitation reaction and used for the
quantification of the antigenic content of tetanus and diphteria toxin
and toxoid. The limes flocculationis is the smallest amount of antigen
that when mixed with one unit (Ramon) of antitoxin (antibody),
produces the most rapid floccules in the flocculation test. For a
purified crystalline tetanus or diphteria toxin 1 Lf is equivalent to
~ 2 &mu;g of protein. For tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, antigenic
purity is defined and controlled by Lf units per mg of protein
nitrogen. 
      </p>
      <p>
Many sources describe the unit of antitoxin as "international unit"
(IU), however, this is no longer correct. It was correct for the first
international standard for antitoxin, established in 1920s. It had an
arbitrary unit defined as IU for in vivo antitoxic activity and that
unit was also used for establishing Lf units of toxins and toxoids,
that is why this standard had a ratio of 1 between flocculating
activity (Lf) and antitoxic activity (IU). When WHO replaced that
standard in 1970s, the second international standard related to Lf by
a factor of 1.4 instead of 1. Ultimately, WHO decided to move to the
toxoid standards and calibrated tetanus toxoid for flocculation using
Lf unit (not IU). With the implementation of WHO standards for
flocculation as tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, antitoxin standards
were discontinued by the WHO.  [Source: <emph>Lyng J. Quantitative

These units are &ldquo;pseudo-units&rdquo; because of their standardized
definition as being logarithms of a ratio of two measurements with the
same kind-of-quantity: first, the units cancel out, and second, the
logarithm does not produce a new unit. These units were defined as
&ldquo;metric&rdquo; because they are used as such, although a multiplication
operation is not defined on these quantities. Multiplication of the
measurement value with a scalar <v>r</v> is equivalent to raising the
original ratio to the <v>r</v>-th power.
      </p>

According to NIST, the neper is used as the ratio level of field
quantities and the bel is used for the level of power quantities. The
factor 2 comes into play when field quantities (like electric
potential) are expressed in decibel. The specialized bel-units B(V),
B(mV), B(W), etc. are defined as the level of the measured quantity
with reference quantities 1&nbsp;V, 1&nbsp;mV, and 1&nbsp;W
respectively. [NIST Sp.&nbsp;Pub. 811, 1995 Edition]

      <p>
Given the sound pressure level expressed in dB(SPL) it is feasible to
define dB(A) for the A scale of loudness. Similar units such as phon
and sone could be defined as well if a good approximation for the
respective characteristic functions are available. Any advice is
welcome.

Although called &ldquo;metric carat,&rdquo; the carat really is a
customary unit, still used for precious gems. The word carat comes
from Greek
&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&iotatonos;&kappa;&omikron;&nu; (small
horn) that originally was the horn-shaped grain of a locust-tree
species in the pea family, hence the carat grain is about three barley
grain that the other English systems of weights are based on. The arab
carat was 1/24 of an ounce, the Imperial carat (1877) was
205.3&nbsp;mg or 3.168&nbsp;grain. In other European cities, the carat
was 205.8&nbsp;mg (Hamburg, Lisboa) but there were great variations
from 188.5&nbsp;mg (Bologna) to 213.5&nbsp;mg (Torino). Due to these
variations no customary carat has gained importance today aside from
the &ldquo;metric carat&rdquo; defined as 200&nbsp;mg exactly.

      </p>
      <p>
The &ldquo;Mark&rdquo; was a mass unit for precious metals (K&ouml;ln 234&nbsp;g,
Paris 245&nbsp;g, Wien 277&nbsp;g). A mark of gold was subdivided into
24 &ldquo;karat,&rdquo; a mark of silver into 16 &ldquo;lot.&rdquo;  This led to the other
use of the unit &ldquo;carat&rdquo; to mean 1/24 in measuring the finesse of
pure gold in an alloy. For example, an 8 carat gold alloy contains 8
parts of gold on 16 parts of silver = 8/24 = 1/3, or 333 per
mille. This carat is spelled &ldquo;karat&rdquo; in the U.S. while other
countries do not use different spellings.

The unit &ldquo;<code>[m/s2/Hz^(1/2)]</code>&rdquo; is defined as a special unit to represent the odd fractional exponent of the second obtaining for the unit of the amplitude spectral density (ASD). It is defined based on the unit for the power spectral density (PSD), that is 1 (m/s2)<sup>2</sup>/Hz or 1 m<sup>2</sup> &middot; s<sup>-3</sup>. Since the two measurements are directly comparable, PSD = ASD<sup>2</sup>.

This table is not complete. There are other units such as shannon
(Sh), erlang (E), or hartley (Hart), for which we had no quantitative
definitions. Any advice is appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
The bit is defined twice. One definition with a subscript letter
&lquo;s&lquo; is defined as the logarithmus dualis of the number of
distinct signals. However this unit can not practically be used to
express more than 1000 bits. Especially when the bit is used to
express transmission rate or memory capacities, floating point
registers would quickly overflow. Therefore we define a second symbol
for bit, without the suffix, to be the dimensionless unit 1.
      </p>
      <p>
The baud (Bd) is the number of distinct signals transmitted per second,
it is <emph>not</emph> the same as bits per second since one distinct signal
usually carries more than one bit of information.

    <head>Summary of Conflicts</head>
    <p>
&TUCUM; is designed and maintained so that severe name conflicts do
not occur. However, avoiding all conflicts is possible only at the
cost of defining very unusual symbols for those units. As the <tabref
ref="conflicts"/> shows, all current conflicts are of type IVa between
metric and nonmetric units. This means that there is only a conflict
if the metric predicate is violated so that non-metric units are used
with a prefix.

    <head>Example Unit Terms</head>
    <p>
The following table lists example unit terms that are commonly used in
medicine. Since the space of possible unit terms is infinite in theory
and very large in practice, no attempt has been made on a systematic
coverage of possible units. All necessary units can be built from the 
rules of &TUCUM; and there is no need of a particular term to be
enumerated in order to be valid.
    </p>
    <p>
The source of this table is the HL7 V2.4 table of units in chapter 7
with many corrections and some modifications.
    </p>
    <p>
The columns are: (1) the case sensitive unit term and variants; (2) a
plain text reading; (3) example use; (4) canonical form. The canonical
form, consisting of 3 columns: (4.1) the magnitude value of the unit term in
terms of the canonical unit; (4.2) a canonical unit term; (4.3) if
applicable a special conversion function code.
    </p>
    <note>
      <p>
When a special conversion function is specified, the conversion takes
more than multiplication with a factor. Implementers should consult
the UCUM specification or the reference implementation for details on
how to apply these conversion functions.
      </p>
    </note>
    <p>
The example unit terms are given with alternatives for the following
reason. The source of the example terms is the HL7 version 2.4
specification of chapter 7. To show the essential differences between
UCUM and the HL7 version 2.4 codes, the first column shows unit terms
that are as similar to the HL7 2.4 published terms as
possible. However, the HL7 version 2.4 suggested unit terms were
sometimes unnecessarily complicated (e.g., the unit 1 dyn cast as 10
&mu;N; decimal factors instead of the standard multiplier prefixes,
nested parenthetical terms in divisions, etc.), even sometimes
suggesting deprecated conventional habits (e.g., using annotations
like "/g{HGB}" instead of just "/g".)  Hence, the second column
"alternative suggestions" lists equivalent unit terms that are either
more straightforward or more appropriate or both.
