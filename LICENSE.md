By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Unified Code for Units
of Measure (UCUM) Version 1.0 License. To the extent this License may be
interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the
Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under
these terms and conditions.

### Section 1. Definitions.

1.1 “**Contribution**” shall mean any
work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any
modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof,
that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by
the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to
submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this
definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but
not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code
control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on
behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the
Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as “Not a
Contribution.”

1.2 “**Contributor**” shall mean
Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a
Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
within the Work.

1.3 “**Derivative Works**” shall
mean any work, in any form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work
and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or
other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of
authorship. For avoidance of doubt, a Software Application that merely
communicates with and/or interoperates with an unmodified instance of
the Work is not a Derivative Work.

1.4 “**Legal Entity**” shall mean the
union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are
controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the
purposes of this definition, “control” means (i) the power, direct or

by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or
more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
entity.

mean the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of

conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by

provided in the Appendix below).

Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

    Rights. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions
    by providing a URL or hyperlink that includes the required
    information when distributing the Work by electronic download.

### Section 4. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If Your institute patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

### Section 5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be

terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

### Section 6. Trademarks.

trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
the Work and reproducing or redistributing the Work as required by
Section 3.

provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on

express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of
\*<span id="TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE"></span>**TITLE,

PURPOSE**\*. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

### Section 8. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages. You are responsible for
and liable for all of Your access to and use of the Work, directly or
indirectly, whether such access or use is permitted by or in violation
of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, You
are responsible for the Software Applications and their use of the Work,
if any. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless all
Contributors and their officers, directors, employees, agents,
affiliates, successors, and assigns from and against any and all losses,
damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments,
settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of
whatever kind, including attorneys’ fees, arising from or relating to
(a) Your use or misuse of the Work, (b) Your breach of this Agreement,
and/or (c) the Software Applications. You may not enter into any
third-party agreement that would, in any manner whatsoever, constitute
an admission of fault by Contributors or bind Contributors in any way,
without prior written consent of all affected Contributors.

### Section 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work, You may choose to offer acceptance of
support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

### Section 10. Term and Termination.

10.1 This License applies for the term of the copyrights licensed here.
However, if You fail to comply with this License, then Your rights under
this License terminate automatically.

10.2 Where Your right to use the Work has terminated under Section 10,
it reinstates: a. automatically as of the date the violation is cured,
provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation;
or b. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Section 10 does not affect any right the Licensor may have
to seek remedies for Your violations of this License.

10.3 For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Work
under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Work at any
time; however, doing so will not terminate this License.

interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
of the Work that could lawfully be made without permission under this
License.

12.2 To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed,
it shall be severed from this License without affecting the
enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

12.3 No term or condition of this License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

12.4 Nothing in this License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply
to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any
jurisdiction or authority.
